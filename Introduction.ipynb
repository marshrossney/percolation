    "# Introduction to Experiment 3\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "Experiment 3 is all about computer modelling.\n",
    "That is, constructing a mathematical model that can be studied by simulating it on a computer.\n",
    "\n",
    "Before you attempt the tasks, read through this notebook.\n",
    "There are no marks associated with this notebook, but it contains important information about what you are doing, as well as practical information on working with Jupyter notebooks.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Modelling and simulations\n",
    "\n",
    "Many people's first thoughts when they head the word \"simulation\" are of things like virtual reality (e.g. the Matrix) or video games.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, such is the importance of computer modelling in the sciences that it has been called the **\"third pillar of science\"**, with the other two (much older) pillars being theoretical and experimental science.\n",
    "\n",
    "A few important points to note are:\n",
    "\n",
    "* A model does not have to be something that is simulated on a computer; many can be studied or even solved completely using **analytical** methods. However, many models (even simple ones) can be tricky or impossible to solve analytically, and **numerical** studies involving simulations are the only approach.\n",
    "  * **Example:** the earliest attempts to build mathematical models of epidemics, which first introduced the concept of the **R-rate**, date back to the 1920s and were studied using analytical methods (computers hadn't been invented!)\n",
    "  * **Example:** the atmosphere is a highly complex and chaotic system, and 'brute force' simulations such as those run by the Met Office are the only real option for predicting the weather.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* Models do not have to be physically realistic to be interesting or useful. Even the most simplistic models can help us to understand physical phenomena qualitatively.\n",
    "  * **Example:** a very simple, 2-dimensional model of air flow around an oval shape provides insight into how lift is generated by aeroplane wings, even though the real situation is vastly more complicated (involving turbulence, humidity etc).\n",
    "  * **Example:** An incredibly simple model called the **Ising model** was introduced in 1924. It describes a set of 'Boolean' variables (either 'on' or 'off', but not in between) on a 2-dimensional lattice. Despite its simplicity, it has been instrumental in understanding a wide range of phenomena, including the phase transition when a liquid turns into a gas (yes, really!), and research papers are still being written about it today.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* Both simple and complex models necessarily make assumptions about the underlying system, so it is important to consider the validity of these assumptions.\n",
    "  * **Example:** Many microeconomic models assume that people behave 'rationally', in the strict sense that they will always make decisions that maximise their own economic position.\n",
    "  * **Example:** Long-term climate models make an assumption about how much carbon dioxide humans will emit over the next few decades. However, this particular assumption can be accounted for by running multiple simulations over a range of possible scenarios - from very optimistic to very pessimistic - and interpreting variations in the predictions as **uncertainties**.\n"

    "## Percolation models\n",
    "\n",
    "In Experiment 3 we will be looking at a particular class of models known as **percolation models**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Percolation sounds complicated but it's probably something you're all familiar with!\n",
    "Physically, percolation describes a substance (the **percolating substance**) propagating through some **medium**, without caring too much about what the substance or the medium actually are, just their general characteristics.\n",
    "\n",
    "A common situation in which percolation is interesting is when liquid propagates through a solid whose structure is irregular and contains gaps through which the liquid can pass.\n",
    "This is something you will have encountered if you have ever\n",
    "* Watered a house-plant\n",
    "* Made a cup of coffee the proper way (i.e. not instant!)\n",
    "* Used a wet sponge in the shower\n",
    "* Made a lemon drizzle cake\n",
    "\n",
    "The most basic question one can ask is whether the liquid percolates (i.e. passes through) or doesn't (i.e. pools on the top).\n",
    "It turns out that, for the majority of percolation models, even this most basic question cannot be precisely answered by writing down the mathematical expressions describing the model and using analytical methods to solve them.\n",
    "Instead, we must use simulations!\n",
    "\n",
    "In these notebooks, we will study a percolation model based on a **square lattice**, which can be thought of as a grid of points called **nodes**. \n",
    "Each nodes has four neighbours - above, below, to the left and to the right - that it can interact with.\n",
    "By interact, we mean that the percolating substance can be transferred from one node to the other.\n",
    "In the simulations, the lattice is represented as a grid of squares, and the colour of a square will indicate whether that node is:\n",
    "* contains the percolating substance (a **live node**)\n",
    "* does not contain the percolating substance, but could potentially at a later time (a **susceptible node**)\n",
    "* does not and cannot contain the percolating substance (an **inert node**)\n",
    "\n",
    "Each of the three notebooks - `task_1` `task_2` and `task_3` - will study a slightly different variation of percolation model.\n",
    "The first notebook will restrict the percolating substance to travelling in only one direction, and the second notebook will restrict it to three directions.\n",
    "The final notebook is the so-called **isotropic** case, where the percolating substance can move in any direction on the lattice.\n",
    "\n",
    "The purpose of these models will **not** be to describe real phenomena in a realistic sense.\n",
    "However, in each of the three notebooks we will motiviate the model using real phenomena.\n",
    "While carrying out the experiments, you should be thinking about how you might extend these models to make them more realistic."
