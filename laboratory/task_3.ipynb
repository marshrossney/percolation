    "In this notebook we will increase the `n_links` parameter to 4, so that the percolating substance can propagate in all four directions.\n",
    "Instead of starting with the top row of the lattice, we will instead start with a central *nucleus*, and define percolation to occur when the percolating substance reaches *any* of the four boundaries.\n",
    "\n",
    "Our model is very similar to the simple pandemic model proposed [here](http://35.161.88.15/interactive/outbreak/), which is also based on a square lattice, where each node represents a 'unit of population' (e.g. a person, or a village), that can either be\n",
    "* Infected (the live nodes; the percolating substance, a.k.a the virus, occupies the node)\n",
    "* Susceptible (the node has not been infected yet)\n",
    "* Immune (the inert nodes represent vaccinated individuals. We can also add to them with nodes who have previously had the virus, but since recovered)\n",
    "\n",
    "The main aim of this notebook is not to build an accurate model of a pandemic, but to follow through the same analysis as the previous notebook and determine the nature of the percolation transition in the infinite-lattice limit.\n",
    "Another way of phrasing this is\n",
    "\n",
    "> What fraction of the population needs to be immune so that there is an effectively zero percent chance of the virus spreading over very large scales (i.e. through a long chain of transmissions)?\n",
    "\n",
    "A similar concept is that of **herd immunity**, which asks\n",
    "\n",
    "> What fraction of the population needs to be immune so that the levels of infection cannot be sustained without constant external input?\n",
    "\n",
    "If the virus reaches the boundary of the lattice (i.e. the simulation percolates), this implies that the initial infection in the centre has led to *at least* one infection on the boundary, which we might interpret as herd immunity not being reached.\n",
    "\n",
    "<div class=\"alert alert-block alert-warning\">\n",
    "<b>Warning!</b> \n",
    "    This model does not pretend to be a realistic model of a pandemic, and herd immunity is identified with the percolation transition in the way we have just outlined. The point is that properties of models, that we can simulate, can be studied to gain insight into real phenomena, so long as we're careful about it!\n",
